# Welcome

Leaderboards.gg is an open source project to create a community needs directed platform for cataloguing and presenting data regarding video game based challenges and competitions.

The project aims to build on and improve systems and tools currently available, with improvements focused on: site performance, user experience, documentation, api functionality, and a method for feedback that will guide future features.

TLDR: Leaderboard website for video games. Both times and scores.

Leaderboards.gg is currently in development, and our alpha "release" will be a set of code repositories that allow for basic user testing and further development. 

(TODO: Trying to say that our "MVP" release isn't a site, but is a code package that we can use for beta testing and gathering user feedback as we continue to build out what will eventually be a hosted site that people can use.)
